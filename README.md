Dr. Fred Edison's incredible useful C++11 libraries
===================================================
May contain traces of industrial strength snake oil

This is a set of small single-header libraries. If not mentioned
otherwise they only need a C++11 compatible compiler. They require no
installation and can be used by copying them into your own projects and
including them directly.

Libraries
---------

*   `dfe_namedtuple.hpp`: allow structs to acts as introspectable named
    tuples and write them into either `.csv` or `.npy` files.
